This was an AI-assisted project creation speed run of 1 hour.
The goal was to check if vibe coding is really worth your time.

The end result, I would say, is that it’s not.
At the initial level, it felt like the AI had proper context and knew what it was doing, but as soon as we kept prompting for more than 20 minutes, it started to miss details and write logic with a new approach, breaking the previous code.

For the first 30 minutes, I tried ChatGPT, and for the latter half, I used Claude.
And to me, it’s quite clear that Claude is superior to ChatGPT when it comes to coding.
