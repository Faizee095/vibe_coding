This was an AI assiested project creation speed run of 1 hours.
The goal was to check is Vibe coding really worth your time.

The end result I would say its not.
At intila level it felt data AI had proper context and knew what it was doing but
as soon as we kept prompting for more that 20 min , it started to miss details and
write logic with new approach and breaking the previous code.

For the first 30 minutes I tried chatgpt and for teh later I used Claude.
And to me ist quite clear the claude is superior to chatgpt when it comes to coding.
